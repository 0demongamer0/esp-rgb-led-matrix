### LED Matrix

The LED matrix consists of 8 x 32 WS2812B LEDs. Each LED has a max. current of 60 mA, which would result in a max. power consumption of 5 V / 15.36 A. The flexible LED panel matrix would be damaged with this high nominal power consumption, therefore it shall be limited to 5 V / 4 A.

Input voltage level:
* High - Min. 0.7 * VDD
  * => 0.7 * 5 V = 3.5 V
* Low - Max. 0.3 * VDD
  * => 0.3 * 5 V = 1.5 V

The i/o pins of the ESP32 are running with a 3.3 V level, which could cause a problem in detection a high!
Therefore the level must be shifted from 3.3 V to 5V.

### Ambient Light Sensor

The following table shows the output voltage, generated by a LDR like the GL5528 and a 1 k resistor. Both assembled as voltage divider.

| Ambient light | Ambient light | Photocell resistance | LDR + R | Voltage across R|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Moonlit night | 1 lux | 70 kΩ | 71 kΩ | 0.046 V |
| Dark room | 10 lux | 10 kΩ | 11 kΩ | 0.3 V |
| Dark overcast day / Bright room | 100 lux | 1.5 kΩ | 2.5 kΩ | 1.32 V |
| Overcast day | 1000 lux | 300 Ω | 1.3 kΩ | 2.538 V |
| Full daylight | 10,000 lux | 100 Ω | 1.1 kΩ | 3.0 V |
